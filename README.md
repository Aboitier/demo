Assessment.

The goal of this exercise is to train your git skills along with neurally reconnecting some shell commands usage we spent time on last week.

To start, you'll have to create a folder whose name will be the first letter of your surname and the rest of your last name. In my case, it'd have been aboitier. Just like it actually is on my git. 

All the work will take place inside this folder.

Then, for every question, you'll have to create a new sub-folder whose name will be comprised of "f_" followed by the question's number. For example, to answer the question 340, you will have to create the f_340 folder and put your file inside it. You can name your file rendu. 

Here is the link of the repo that you have to clone to start: https://github.com/Aboitier/demo.git
Don't forget to work in the repo since you'll have to push all your work. Only what's on the repo will be evaluated. 

And there it started...
1) What is the command that prints a list of the current directory contents ? No flag required
2) How would you manipulate `git reflog`'s output to print only the hash of the latest commit ? Give the command
3) How many vowels are there in the following sentence: "we all love pasta alla carbonara con leche" ? Give the command
4) You are in your answer_folder/question4_folder/ and you want to copy the answer file located in the answer_folder/question2_folder. What is the command to do that ?
5) Write a .gitignore that will ignore .o files as well as files located in the logs/ folder except the file logs/test.
6) Can you write a Shell script shebang ? Bonus, can you explain its purpose ? 
7) Following question 6), can you write a Shell script that prints "neat bruh" if we input 'Z' to it ?
